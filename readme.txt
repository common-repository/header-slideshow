Slideshow of user defined images of configurable size, position and timing.

== Description ==

Many websites implement a slideshow of images implemented in Flash.  The header-slideshow plugin uses HTML and JavaScript to achieve the same effect.  

The plugin is easily installed and configured to user requirements, through the modification of the example xml file included in the package, and in the Header Slideshow page under Settings in the Admin area of Wordpress.  

The XML file contains relative file paths for the images that the slideshow will display and also defines their order.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin:

1. Upload the entire contents of the plugin package to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Modify the settings in the Header Slideshow settings page, under Settings in WordPress
4. Modify the .xml file with the URLs to your own images, noting that the .xml file specifies the order of display
5. Upload your images to the URLs specified in the .xml
6. Upload the new .xml file and, if necessary, modify the location in the Header Slideshow settings page, under Settings
